Jymmz Breaks the ground in this momentous event
Hello, I am Jymmz pronouced Jim-zee, I know sounds silly it comes from a childhood t shirt in my BMX Days that sort of stuck.
I am learning the ropes or strings to do with Git and hopefully making some interesting commits in the future.
I am hobbyist in arduino and beaglebone the potentials with developing this technology we havent seen the end of yet.
Look forward to collaborating with fellow enthusiast and professionals out there the load is heavy but many hands make easy work of it.
Dream Big!!
